    "description": "In Batch 8 of the Web Development Course with Jhankar Mahbub, I learned the essentials of web development. Starting with HTML for page structure, I then added style with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript. I explored modern styling tools like Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI. Moving on, React JS helped me build dynamic user interfaces, while Node.js empowered me to create backend applications. MongoDB taught me database management. With these skills, I'm now equipped to develop full-stack web applications."
